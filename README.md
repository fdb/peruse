# peruse

Peruse is a RSS web aggregator.
It collects feed data in the background and shows updated feeds as they come in.

- The main web application, peruse.web.
- The peruse fetcher, peruse.worker, that fetches updated feeds.

To run the web application:

    lein run
    
To run the worker:

    lein run -m peruse.worker
